For the past six weeks I have been a student in the trailblazing softare engineering career accelerator called Hack Reactor.  I have been more than impressed with the members of my cohort.  Some are new to javascript and the MEAN stack, much like myself, but everyone seems to have no fear diving right into the unknown.  I for one, am overwhelmed, but feeling more and more confident with each exercise (and some quiet time into the wee hours at home hacking away and trying to decipher code).

More to come..
