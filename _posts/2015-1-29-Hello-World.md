# Recursion - Tips and Pitfalls

If you enjoy puzzles and programming, you might enjoy implementing solutions
using recursive techniques.  Although a powerful tool, recursion can lead to
some head-banging confusion.  I've put together some things to keep in mind
while writing your recursive algorithms.

#\#1 - Base Case (or exit condition)

Some text here

```javascript
var x = 7;
```

#\#2 - Be mindful of what you're returning

Some more text here

```javascript
var y = 5;

```
#\#3 - When in doubt, draw it out


#\#4 - The function doesn't end with the recursive call
