# Using Bootstrap to quickly get your website style in line

I enjoy learning CSS tricks and tips, however when I'm developing web sites I prefer to focus more on the architecture and functionality and less about centering my divs and making my buttons look pretty.  This is where Bootstrap really comes to the rescue.

Bootstrap can be used in its simplest form as one large, ready-to-go stylesheet.  All you have to do is follow some simple rules and Bootstrap will make your markup look attractive.
