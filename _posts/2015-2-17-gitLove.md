# Cloning a local repo to github

In the usual flow of development we create or fork a repo on github and then clone it down to our machine.  But sometimes we end up starting a project on our machine and would like to move it to github.  This short tutorial will explain how to do so.

While in your project folder you will first want to run 'git init', if you haven't already done so.

```
git init
```
This will initialize a git repository in your directory where you can add and commit your existing files.

Next you might want to clone this to a github repo.  What I do is create an empty repo on github with the same directory name as the local directory on my machine where I have my project. Then run the following commands:

```
cd <into_your_local_repo>
git remote add origin <your_github_repo_address>
git push origin master
```

And there you have it.. So easy that you might not think of it at first...
