# Pair Programming

Pair programming is a method used in many development environments where two software engineers work together on the same machine to solve a problem.  Before I had tried pair programming it sounded interesting but I was unsure of the mechanics.  This post will discuss those mechanics and give advice on how to get the most out of it, from my experience.

When pair programming, both developers will each have a monitor, mouse and keyboard connected to the same computer.  Ideally, one developer would be designated as the driver and the other as the navigator.  The driver takes on the role of typing while the navigator instructs the driver on what to type and where.

### Who should drive and who should navigate?

After doing the usual pre-coding work, i.e. whiteboarding to find the best solution and writing out some pseudocode, they could switch off driving and navigating every 20 minutes or so.  This gives each a chance to try out each of these roles. 

However, if the two developers have different skill levels, usually it is best for the more advanced programmer to navigate and the other to drive.  This gives the driver a chance to type out the navigators plan.  Although the less experienced programmer should also try to navigate when possible to practice their coding recall skills.

Pair programming is not only a great way to witness another developer's thought process, but also helps both developers improve their soft skills working in a small team.  It is a great way to tackle problems in a fast manner as two minds are usually better than one.  It is amazing how much you can learn from each other, and how fast you can rip out quality code.
